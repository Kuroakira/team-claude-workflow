# Systematic Debugging

Diagnose root causes through evidence, not guesswork. Never jump to a fix without understanding why.

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIX WITHOUT A PROVEN DIAGNOSIS
```

## 4-Phase Process

### Phase 1: Reproduce

Establish a reliable way to trigger the bug.

```
1. Get reproduction steps (from user, logs, or error report)
2. Run them. Does the bug actually happen?
3. If not reproducible → gather more context, don't guess
4. Document: exact command, input, expected vs actual output
```

**Exit criteria**: You can trigger the bug on demand.

### Phase 2: Isolate

Narrow down to the smallest scope that still fails.

```
1. Remove unrelated code/config changes
2. Simplify the input
3. Identify the last known good state (git log, git bisect)
4. Find the minimal reproduction case
```

**Exit criteria**: You know which component/function/line is responsible.

### Phase 3: Diagnose

Form hypotheses and test them with evidence.

```
1. List plausible hypotheses (minimum 2)
2. For each hypothesis, define:
   - What evidence would PROVE it
   - What evidence would DISPROVE it
3. Gather evidence (read code, add logging, inspect state)
4. Eliminate hypotheses that contradict evidence
5. The surviving hypothesis is your diagnosis
```

**For complex bugs with 3+ plausible hypotheses**: Use `agent-team-execution` (Competing Hypothesis Debugging) to test hypotheses in parallel.

**Exit criteria**: One hypothesis survives with supporting evidence.

### Phase 4: Fix & Verify

Apply the fix and prove the bug is gone.

```
1. Write a test that captures the bug (RED)
2. Apply the minimal fix (GREEN)
3. Run the reproduction steps — bug must be gone
4. Run full test suite — no regressions
5. Quote the verification output (verification-before-completion)
```

**Exit criteria**: Test passes, reproduction steps no longer trigger the bug.

## Red Flags

- "I think I know what's wrong" before Phase 1 is complete
- Jumping from Phase 1 to Phase 4 (skipping Isolate and Diagnose)
- Only one hypothesis considered in Phase 3
- Applying a fix without a failing test
- Claiming "fixed" without re-running reproduction steps

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Response |
|--------|----------|
| "It's obvious, no need to reproduce" | Obvious bugs have hidden causes. Reproduce first. |
| "I'll just try this quick fix" | That's guessing, not debugging. Diagnose first. |
| "There's only one possible cause" | There are always at least two. List them. |
| "No time for a test" | A bug without a test will come back. Write the test. |
| "It works now after my change" | Correlation is not causation. Explain WHY it works. |

## Integration

- **agent-team-execution**: Phase 3 escalation for competing hypothesis debugging
- **verification-before-completion**: Phase 4 requires fresh evidence before claiming "fixed"
- **code-quality-rules**: Phase 4 follows TDD (failing test first, then fix)
- **subagent-driven-development**: After diagnosis, the fix is implemented as a task with spec + review
