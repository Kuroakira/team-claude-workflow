Invoke the skills `getting-started` and `design-doc-format`, then begin the **Design Phase**:

1. Review research findings and current understanding
2. Create a Design Doc following the **Why Over How** principle:
   - **Write WHY generously**: problem context, constraints, decision rationale, rejected alternatives
   - **Write HOW sparingly**: no code examples, directory structures, or implementation details unless they ARE the design decision
3. Structure the doc with clear sections:
   - Overview (what and why it matters)
   - Goals / Non-Goals
   - Background (problem in detail)
   - Proposal (key design decisions with reasoning)
   - Alternative Concerns (mandatory — prevents newcomers from re-asking the same questions)
   - Concerns (risks, uncertainties, ambiguities)
4. Present the doc for human review before proceeding
