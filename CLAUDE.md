# Team Claude Workflow - Project Overview

## Purpose

Systematize team development workflows for Claude Code as skills, published as a GitHub repository.
Inspired by obra/superpowers, with these unique values:

1. **Self-Evolving Quality Rules** - Discover issues during implementation → propose rule addition → approve → update SKILL.md
2. **Team Development First** - Design Docs, Notion integration, team review flows
3. **Context Recovery** - Smooth state restoration after compact/clear via SessionStart hook

## Core Workflow

```
/research → /design → Team Review → /plan → /implement → /review
                                               ↑
                                    Issue found → update Doc → redo
```

## Quality Rules (defined in code-quality-rules)

- **TDD Required** - If you wrote production code before tests, delete and redo
- **No `as`** - Never use TypeScript type assertions
- **No eslint-disable** - Fix lint errors in code
- **No Lazy Assertions** - Don't settle for just `toBeDefined()`
- **Post-Implementation Checks Required** - Run typecheck, lint, test, build every time
- **Verification Before Completion** - No success claims without fresh evidence
- **No Hardcoded Secrets** - Use environment variables, never commit secrets
- **Input Validation at Boundaries** - Validate all external input
- **No Dynamic Code Execution** - No eval(), Function(), exec()
- **Dependency Awareness** - Check before adding dependencies

## Next Tasks

1. **incremental-review** skill - Show small changes with reasoning
   - No bulk implementations, explain "what" and "why" per change

## Research Policy

- **Web-first research** - Always search the web rather than relying on internal knowledge alone
- **Cite sources** - Every claim must include a clear source (URL, documentation link, or repository reference)
- **No hallucinated references** - If a source cannot be found or verified, state that explicitly
- **Prefer primary sources** - Official docs > blog posts > Stack Overflow
- **Recency matters** - Prefer up-to-date sources; flag if information may be outdated

## Language Policy

- **User-facing outputs** (Design Docs, reports, explanations, proposals) → Use the language of the user's request
- **Internal files** (SKILL.md, CLAUDE.md, code comments in skills) → Always English to reduce token consumption
- When the self-evolution protocol adds a new rule to SKILL.md → English regardless of the conversation language

## Design Decisions

- Distributed as Claude Code plugin via marketplace system (install/uninstall/update with one command)
- Self-evolving quality rules implemented via direct SKILL.md edits
- Notion integration handled through format rules (API integration for future consideration)
- SessionStart hook auto-injects getting-started skill (no CLAUDE.md dependency for bootstrap)
- Skill descriptions contain ONLY trigger conditions (CSO — prevents shortcut behavior)
